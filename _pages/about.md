## Specialization

Embedded C++ and Rust on STM32, adapting and using modern practices of software development in embedded systems, such as unit testing and CI/CD with HIL testing, to aid with development and maintenance of complex systems.

## Interests

Has a broad understanding of embedded systems, from hardware design (priciples of semiconductors, FPGAs, analog and digital circuits, building prototypes and hardware bring-up), through computer and software architecture, all the way to the product life-cycle, real-world manufacturing constraints and customer needs.

Also likes to venture into high-performance backend services, deployment and applications of machine learning, cloud computing, and many more things.
