## Specialization

Embedded C++ and Rust on STM32, adapting and using modern practices of software development in embedded systems, such as unit testing and CI/CD with HIL testing, to aid with development and maintenance of complex systems.

## Interests

Has a broad understanding of embedded systems, from hardware design (principles of semiconductors, FPGAs, analog and digital circuits, building prototypes, and hardware bring-up), through computer and software architecture, all the way to the product life-cycle, real-world manufacturing constraints, and customer needs.

Also likes to venture into high-performance backend services, deployment and applications of machine learning, cloud computing, and more.

## Work Experience

**Software Engineer at [DX Heroes](https://www.dxheroes.io/)/[Applifting](https://applifting.io/) (Nov 2024 - now)**

**Technical Lead at [Z-Bionics](https://www.z-bionics.com/) (Jan 2021 - Jul 2022 - Oct 2024)**

Joined the core team to help out with the firmware development initially, gradually transitioned into a team lead, and finally also took on most of the high-level product design. My responsibilities include

- Leading a team of firmware developers, a hardware designer and a full-stack web developer
  - Two major hardware platform redesigns took place over the course of my involvement, we have perfected it and kept up with the changing requirements; designing, manufacturing, and bringing up five hardware revisions in total
  - The team also delivered robust, maintainable, and testable firmware for all the sub-components within the product. Challenges included motor control, detection of abnormal events, and muscle signal processing
  - We developed a web-based configuration interface for internal uses and training as well as a mobile application for customer use.
- Overlooking quality assurance and testing, CI/CD and documentation
  - All major release and packaging tasks are automated.
- Coordinating design and manufacturing with other teams and external partners
  - Mechanical design for packaging, motor drive, and control capability assessment
  - PCB manufacturing and assembly with local and overseas vendors.

<!-- The electronics need to conform to the specific requirements of the product, which is built unique for each customer. The tech needs to get out of the way of mechanical parts, to keep the aesthetics and rigidity, while working with tight power and space constraints. With each iteration we managed to better integrate the design, optimize for assembly, increase observability of anomalies and decrease the power consumption. -->
