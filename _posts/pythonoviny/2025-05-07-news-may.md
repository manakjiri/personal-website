title: Python News (May)
---

A month went by since I started writing these posts, so let's do another news round to celebrate!

## What's new in Python

Version [3.13.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3133/) came out on April the 8th as the third maintenance update of the `3.13` version. It includes [320 merged PRs](https://docs.python.org/release/3.13.3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-3), and here is a quick overview:

Security Enhancements
- Upgraded bundled libexpat to 2.7.1 to patch vulnerabilities.
- Fixed a spoofing risk in email module (rfc2047 encoded-word parsing).
- Prevented unbounded memory usage in `tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile.writelines()`.

Free-threaded Build Stabilization
- Numerous data race and crash fixes in `list`/`dict` manipulation, `locals()`, and `set.clear()`.
- Improved performance and memory handling in free-threading environments.
- Thread-safe updates in PyList_Insert, PyList_SetItem, and GC functions (more about that in an upcoming post).

Overall, this release focuses on security, macOS/Windows installer updates, thread-safety, REPL improvements, and bug fixes across core, libraries, and tests. It is a maintenance update after all.

## Updates in widely-used libraries

Pydantic [2.11](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/changelog/) was released and it brings significant performance improvements. According to the [official release article](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-11-release), you can expect up to a 2x improvement in schema build times and up to 5x lower total memory allocated. There is now also support for [Python's type parameter lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params) (introduced in 3.12) and the long-awaited `serialize_by_alias` to go along with `validate_by_alias` ðŸŽ‰.

## New projects

[Astral](https://astral.sh/), the creators of uv and ruff, have [announced](https://x.com/charliermarsh/status/1884651482009477368?t=D0LEsikcNm4L9EKmR64IpA&s=19) that they are working on a new static type analyzer tool called `red-knot` that is slated to replace [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) once released.
