title: Welcome to Pythonoviny
---

Starting this month, I'd like to introduce a weekly newsletter-like channel centered around Python (the programming language) and its ecosystem. Sometimes I might summarize some high-level updates that have happened, sometimes I will dive deeper if I find the subject particularly relevant to [DXH](https://dxheroes.io) and the various projects we are involved in.

Since this the first issue, I'd like to zoom out and provide a snapshot of the current state of the Python ecosystem and also briefly explain how Python's development is managed.

### Governance
Python follows a **Steering Council model**, introduced after [Guido van Rossum](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) stepped down as "Benevolent Dictator for Life" in 2018. The Steering Council is elected by core developers and oversees major decisions.

### Python Enhancement Proposals
New features, standards, or governance changes go through the **PEP process**:
1. A PEP author writes a proposal.
2. It is discussed in the community, often on the `python-dev` mailing list or forums.
3. The proposal is refined and reviewed by a PEP delegate or the Steering Council.
4. If accepted, it gets scheduled for implementation in a future Python release.

An example of recently [rejected](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-2026-calendar-versioning-for-python/55782/125) proposal is [PEP 2026](https://peps.python.org/pep-2026/), which pushed for calendar versioning. A typical PEP is debated and iterated on for 6 months to 2 years.

### Implementations
We are all used running `python script.py`, but there are also other ways. **CPython** is the reference implementation and the most widely used one - it is written in C as the name suggests. Version [3.13.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/) was released on February 4th as the latest stable release.

Other implementations
- [PyPy](https://pypy.org/features.html) is Just-in-Time compiled version of Python, which can speed-up computationally-heavy programs and decrease their memory footprint. The latest supported version of Python is 3.11.11
- [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) and [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) are small enough to run on embedded devices, though they only support a subset of the standard library

### Recent Developments
- PyPI, the Python Package Index, added support for [iOS](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/) and [Android](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/) pre-compiled wheels (python's package format)
- What does 3.13 bring to the table?
    - **Developer experience:** [better interactive interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter) and [colorized exception tracebacks](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#improved-error-messages) (this one surprised me when my terminal turned purple all of a sudden)
    - **Performance:** an [experimental JIT mode](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#an-experimental-just-in-time-jit-compiler) (mostly ground-work); the option to disable the [Global Interpreter Lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) allowing actual multithreading in Python programs (this has been discussed since the dawn of time in the Python community and is a major change to Python's internals, to which I would like to dedicate more time in upcoming posts)
    - **Typing:** since their introduction in [version 3.5](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/), type hints have become an integral part of the modern Python developer experience, enabling better auto-complete and linter checks. 3.13 continues to enhance typing support - notably adds support for [type defaults in type parameters](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/).
