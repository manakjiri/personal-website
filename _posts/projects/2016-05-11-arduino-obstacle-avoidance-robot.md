It was supposed to be a [prototyping platform]({% image_url robot_top.jpg %}) for room navigation algorithms but it never really got that far. The ultrasonic sensors were very unreliable and frequently gave false measurements.

I may revisit this someday. Nowadays there are sensors much better suited for this, in my opinion, like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3317) time of flight sensor and some mm-Wave sensors. I have a certain vision in mind.
