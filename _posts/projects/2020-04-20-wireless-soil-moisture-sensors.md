A network of ultra-low power low-cost maintenance-free outdoor wireless sensors connected to a base station to provide soil moisture readout for monitoring or automatic watering purposes.

The image shows a working prototype of the base station. The drawing was just a very simple way of demonstrating that the touchscreen works.

This project got abandoned at the end. I would like to keep it up here regardless because I learned a tremendous amount thanks to it, which helped me move forward (let that be a lesson for others I guess. In a good sense of course). I also later learned that creating and maintaining a consumer product like this is more difficult than I anticipated when starting it (not that I thought it would be easy).
